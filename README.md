# What I did
I created a Note application in React that allows the user to create, edit, and delete notes on a noteboard. The data is stored in Firebase in order to update the notes across all interfaces. 

# What worked & What didn't
It took me awhile to really understand React and how the components interact with each other. In the end, the app works, and I'm extremely proud of that!

I also added a feature that changes the color of the note when the user is editing.

# Extra Credit 1: Undo Button
I added an undo button! I decided to only have the button show up if you have edited something, as seen below.

# Extra Credit 2: Color Changes
With 30 minutes before the lab due, I thought I'd put my React skills to the test, and I think it worked out! Added a feature where you can change the color of your note wahoo!
