# What I did
I created a Note application in React that allows the user to create, edit, and delete notes on a noteboard. The data is stored in Firebase in order to update the notes across all interfaces. 

# What worked & What didn't
It took me awhile to really understand React and how the components interact with each other. In the end, the app works, and I'm extremely proud of that!

I also added a feature that changes the color of the note when the user is editing.

I wanted to eventually implement a cool feature that lets the user change the border color of the note, but unfortunately I ran out of time. 

# Extra Credit
While I didn't end up implementing something that lets the user change the border color, I did add an undo button! I decided to only have the button show up if you have edited something, as seen below.
